      But every time I learn something new it pushes out something old Remember that time I took a home wine-making course and forgot how to drive When will I learn The answer to lifes problems arent at the bottom of a bottle theyre on TV h people can come up with statistics to prove anything Kent. 14% of people know that. Theres no justice like angry-mob justice. Homer Simpson I show you pity and how do you repay me With a kick in the kididdlehopper Dear Lord The gods have been good to me. For the first time in my life everything is absolutely perfect just the way it is. So heres the deal You freeze everything the way it is and I wont ask for anything more. If that is okay please give me absolutely no sign... Okay deal. In gratitude I present you this offering of cookies and milk. If you want me to eat them for you give me no sign... Thy will be done. I think Smithers picked me because of my motivational skills. Everyone says they have to work a lot harder when Im around. Thats it You people have stood in my way long enough. Im going to clown college Im Bart Simpson who the hell are you

Bart with 10000 wed be millionaires We could buy all kinds of useful things like...love Lisa get in here... In this house we obey the laws of thermodynamics Mrs. Krabappel went to Idaho. Turns out the people sent to rescue her sister from a cult turned out to be an even worse cult. Metric system is the tool of the devil My car gets forty rods to the hogs-head and thats the way I likes it (In real terms thats 0.8m per litre.) Im never going to be disabled. Im sick of being so healthy. Hey is there a Butz here Seymour Butz Hey everybody I wanna Seymour Butz Ive done everything the Bible says -- even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff
