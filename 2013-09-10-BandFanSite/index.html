<h1>Biography</h1>
<h2>Ruston, Louisiana, United States (1991 – 1999, 2013 – present)</h2>
<p>
Neutral Milk Hotel is an American indie rock band formed by singer, guitarist, and songwriter Jeff Mangum in the early 1990s. On the band’s two full-length albums, Mangum played with a number of other musicians, notably Jeremy Barnes (drums), Scott Spillane (horns), Julian Koster (musical saw/banjo/accordion/bass guitar) and producer-instrumentalist Robert Schneider. Neutral Milk Hotel was one of the original members of the Elephant Six Collective, based in Athens, Georgia. They have been on an indefinite hiatus since 1998 and since then developed an increasing cult following within the indie-music scene with Jeff Mangum enjoying almost legendary status.

Prior to recording for friends under the NMH moniker, Mangum recorded at least one cassette under the name Milk: the only known tape was called Pygmie Barn in E Minor. This is the earliest known recordings that Mangum initiated and executed himself, on the cover there is “all songs: j.m ‘89. art: w. cullen hart”. There is only an estimated dozen or so copies ever made of this tape, none of which have been made public. The tracklist etc. are also unknown.

Neutral Milk Hotel began life in Ruston, Louisiana, United States in the early 1990s, simply as a recording project for Mangum. He produced several demo cassettes, among them 1991’s Invent Yourself a Shortcake, 1992’s Beauty and 1993’s Hype City Soundtrack, along with two more from this period, seemingly unnamed.
